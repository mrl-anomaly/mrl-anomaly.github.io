We are the MIT Mechatronics Research Laboratory (MRL). We are currently conducting research in health monitoring/anomaly detection on physical machines. We previously proposed a general purpose anomalous scenario synthesizer (GPASS) to generate various forms of reproducible, controlled dynamic anomalies to a rotary plant. 

In the latest set up, the GPASS collects around 28 real-time sensor signals in multiple domains, e.g., angular displacement, velocity, acceleration, magnetic field, strain and so on. Most sensors run at a minimum of 80Hz. So, that’s a lot of data points.  

Here, we published the data as we ran experiments locally for ourselves. The data are preliminarily pre-processed, such as fusing data streams from multiple sensors, synchronizing the time-frame, etc. However, the contents are intact. 

Good news is that we want to do more than just share the data. The GPASS works as a ‘cloud hardware platform’ that accepts ‘quotes’ for anomalous scenarios. If you want a characterized test run for your experiment, fill out the survey. The setup currently supports:

1. Large lateral force (~20N)
2. High frequency vibration (contact method: 50Hz, contactless method: regulated at 100Hz max)
3. Grinding (force customizable)
4. Scratching
5. Rotational damping 

There is still more to come in the future! Feel free to contact us to develop a new anomalous mode together. The status of the GPASS is publicly available via sensor and video online <a href="https://thingspeak.com/channels/1289599"> here</a>.


Our conference proceeding "A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer for Rotary Equipment" entered the Automation Award Finalist in ICRA 2021!!

The GPASS software and hardware apparatus are detailed in [1]. Currently, we support three health mode controls, including rotational damping (D-mode), large stationary shear load (N-mode), and vibratory shear load (V-mode). These conditions can be commanded either healthy or anomalous, with a specific anomalous attribute. The attributes are:
D-mode: Discrete damping motor resistance from 1 to 15Ω, with 15Ω as a healthy operating condition.
N-mode: Continuous shear load from 0-15N, with 0N as a healthy operating condition.
V-mode: Discrete vibratory excitation from 0-25Hz, with 0Ω as a healthy operating condition.

In [2], we talked about how to generate Markov-Chain based packets to generate automated health mode trajectory. You can participate in the GPAD archive augmentation process by submitting your own packet! As an instructional sample, the following packet:
